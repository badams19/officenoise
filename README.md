# Office Noise

This is a whimsical google chrome extension based on the TV show [The Office (US)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)).
Inspired by the magical auditory experience of [Office Ladies](https://officeladies.com/), and saddened by Netflix's tragic removal of the show in
January 2021, I decided to create a way to hear the casts' voices at the touch of a button.

## Current Features

* Trivia game
  * Plays a short audio clip, if you guess the right season you advance to round 2
  * Round two continues the scene with a subsequent clip, if you guess the correct
  next line of dialogue, you're taken to a youtube video that finishes the scene
  * Guess the wrong answer twice and you have the option to restart the game
* 9 sets of audio so far (one for each season)

## Future features

* Different difficulties
* Better styling and office-themed font
* Spinoff extension? More shows?
