# Office Noise

This is a whimsical google chrome extension based on the TV show [The Office (US)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)).
Inspired by the magical auditory experience of [Office Ladies](https://officeladies.com/), and saddened by Netflix's tragic removal of the show in
January 2021, I decided to create a way to hear the casts' voices at the touch of a button.

## Installation

1. Download the project by clicking on the green ***Code*** button at the top right of the screen and selecting ***Download Zip***. Alternatively, [click this link](https://github.com/badams19/officenoise/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
2. Navigate to your file manager (Finder on Mac, File Explorer on Windows) and go to your downloads folder. Open the zip file entitled `officenoise-master.zip`. A file entitled `officenoise-master` will appear.
3. As this is a google chrome extension, it only works in a chrome browser. (If you don't have chrome installed, you can [download it for free here](https://www.google.com/chrome/).) Open a chrome browser window and type **chrome://extensions** into the address bar.
4. In the top right corner of the window, there is an toggle switch labeled ***Developer mode***. Toggle that button to ensure developer mode is *turned on*.
5. Now, near the top left corner of your screen, click the button labeled ***Load unpacked***. A popup will ask you for a file(s) to select. Select the *unzipped* folder `officenoise-master` from step two.
6. Finally, in the top right corner of your chrome browser (above ***Developer mode***), click on the jigsaw puzzle piece icon. A drop-down list of extensions should appear. Find the item in the list named ***OfficeNoise*** and click the thumbtack icon to the right so that it fills in blue. The ***OfficeNoise*** extension is now pinned to your chrome toolbar; it is the tiny beet icon (![beet icon](beeticon16.png)) to the left of the jigsaw puzzle piece.
7. Click the ![beet icon](beeticon16.png) to get started!
